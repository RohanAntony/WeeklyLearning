# React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
- Not necessarily but usage of JSX is helpful

## Creating a components
1.  Basics
    - Bootstraping can be done through `create-react-app` which is installed globally using `npm install -g create-react-app`
    - `npm start` will start the development server that can be viewed at http://localhost:3000
    - `export default App` is a default export and can be imported with `import App from './App.js'`
    - Refer [Mozilla reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) for more details about named and default export. Only one default export per module but multiple named export are allowed.
