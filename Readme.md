# Weekly learning

This repository is supposed to only stand as a shortcut for quick recalls of different frameworks in JS and other libraries and not as a tutorial.

Every language has it features and drawbacks. I try to record and keep the important features of any framework here so as to remember how to work on it.

I have lately come to the realisation that I switch frameworks without gaining more in detail knowledge about any framework leading to poor understanding of the JS ecosystem.

## Included Repositories
- React
